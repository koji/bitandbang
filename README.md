It's me, Tierney!

# Usage

## npm
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
npx kojikanao
=======
npx koji
>>>>>>> 384d9b2c91365b670a611801388814ef85fa36ae
```

## GitHub Package Registry
Assuming you have the GitHub registry set up, you can use via npx:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
npx @kojikanao/card
=======
npx @koji/card
>>>>>>> 384d9b2c91365b670a611801388814ef85fa36ae
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
